Hi, are you at your desk? I need you to handle a quick favour for me.
I'm in a meeting and can't take calls. I need 6 Apple gift cards (€200 each) for a client today. Scratch off the back and send me photos of the codes by end of day.

Please keep this confidential for now — it's a surprise.

What is the best first step?', options: ['Log in quickly to be safe', 'Reply asking if it is real', 'Open your mail portal yourself (not via the link) or ask IT', 'Forward it to colleagues to warn them'], answer: 2, why: 'Go to the service yourself.
